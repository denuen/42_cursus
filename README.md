# My 42 Cursus Journey

This repository serves as a detailed chronicle of my progress through the 42 programming curriculum. It showcases the development of my coding abilities and conceptual knowledge across various fields of computer science. The graphics project `FDF` and the group projects `minishell` and `cub3d` can be found in separate repositories.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository (for detailed information, enter the corresponding folder):

### libft ([`libft`](./libft/))

A foundational C library containing reimplementations of many standard C functions as well as other useful utility functions. This is the first project of the 42 curriculum.

### ft_printf ([`ft_printf`](./ft_printf/))

A custom implementation of the standard C library function `printf`. This project focuses on variadic functions and string formatting.

### get_next_line ([`get_next_line`](./get_next_line/))

A function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. This project challenges memory management and file I/O skills.

### Philosophers ([`philo`](./philo/))

An implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, a classic synchronization problem in computer science. This project delves into multithreading, mutexes, and avoiding deadlocks.

### Minitalk ([`minitalk`](./minitalk/))

A client-server communication program using only UNIX signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2). This project explores signal handling and binary data transmission.

### C++ Modules ([`cpp_modules`](./cpp_modules/))

A series of modules covering the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C++. Each module contains exercises focused on specific topics, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming.

### NetPractice ([`NetPractice`](./NetPractice/))

A series of exercises designed to teach the basics of networking and IP addressing. The goal is to correctly configure network interfaces to allow machines to communicate.

### Inception ([`inception`](./inception/))

A project focused on system administration and containerization. It involves setting up a multi-service web application using Docker, including Nginx, WordPress, and MariaDB and many other services.
