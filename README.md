# My 42 Cursus Journey

This repository serves as a detailed chronicle of my progress through the 42 programming curriculum. It showcases the development of my coding abilities and conceptual knowledge across various fields of computer science. The graphics project [`FDF`](https://github.com/denuen/FDF.git) and the group projects [`minishell`](https://github.com/denuen/mini_shell.git) and [`cub3d`](https://github.com/denuen/cub3d.git) can be found in separate repositories.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository (for detailed informations, enter the corresponding folder):

### libft ([`libft`](./libft/)) - Grade: 125/100

A foundational C library containing reimplementations of many standard C functions as well as other useful utility functions. This is the first project of the 42 curriculum.


### ft_printf ([`ft_printf`](./ft_printf/))  - Grade: 100/100

A custom implementation of the standard C library function `printf`. This project focuses on variadic functions and string formatting.


### get_next_line ([`get_next_line`](./get_next_line/)) - Grade: 125/100

A function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. This project challenges memory management and file I/O skills.


### Philosophers ([`philo`](./philo/)) - Grade: 125/100

An implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, a classic synchronization problem in computer science. This project delves into multithreading, mutexes, and avoiding deadlocks.


### Minitalk ([`minitalk`](./minitalk/)) - Grade: 125/100

A client-server communication program using only UNIX signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2). This project explores signal handling and binary data transmission.


### FDF ([`FDF`](https://github.com/denuen/FDF.git)) - Grade: 125/100

A 3D wireframe graphics project. It reads a map of coordinates and renders it as a 3D model, exploring concepts of graphical representation and transformations.


### Minishell ([`minishell`](https://github.com/denuen/mini_shell.git)) - Grade: 123/100

A custom-built UNIX shell that can parse and execute commands. This project covers process management, signal handling, and implementing shell features like pipes and redirections.


### cub3d ([`cub3d`](https://github.com/denuen/cub3d.git)) - Grade: 122/100

A 3D game engine built from scratch using raycasting techniques, inspired by Wolfenstein 3D. It involves parsing map files, rendering a 3D world, and managing player interaction.


### C++ Modules ([`cpp_modules`](./cpp_modules/)) - Grade: can be found individually for each module

A series of modules covering the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C++. Each module contains exercises focused on specific topics, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming.


### NetPractice ([`NetPractice`](./NetPractice/)) - Grade: 100/100

A series of exercises designed to teach the basics of networking and IP addressing. The goal is to correctly configure network interfaces to allow machines to communicate.


### Inception ([`inception`](./inception/)) - Grade: 125/100

A project focused on system administration and containerization. It involves setting up a multi-service web application using Docker, including Nginx, WordPress, and MariaDB and many other services.
