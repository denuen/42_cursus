# NetPractice

A foundational project from the 42 curriculum, designed to introduce the core concepts of networking. This project provides a series of interactive exercises that simulate small-scale networks, allowing for hands-on practice with TCP/IP addressing and configuration.

---

## Project Overview

NetPractice is an interactive, browser-based training tool that challenges you to solve 10 distinct networking problems. Each level presents a misconfigured network diagram that must be corrected by properly configuring IP addresses, netmasks, and gateways for various devices.

---

### Key Objectives

- **Understand TCP/IP Addressing**: Learn how IP addresses, subnets, and gateways work together.
- **Network Configuration**: Gain practical experience in configuring network interfaces for hosts and routers.
- **Problem Solving**: Develop troubleshooting skills by diagnosing and fixing common network issues.
- **Simulated Environment**: Work within a safe, simulated environment that provides immediate feedback.
---

## How It Works

The project is composed of a self-contained web interface that runs locally in your browser.

---

### The Interface

- **Network Diagram**: Each level displays a visual representation of the network, including machines, routers, and their connections.
- **Configuration Fields**: Editable fields for IP addresses, netmasks, and default gateways are provided for each device.
- **Goal Display**: A clear objective is stated at the top of the page for each level.
- **Real-time Feedback**: A log at the bottom of the page provides hints and error messages to guide you.
---

### Solving a Level

1.  **Analyze the Diagram**: Understand the network topology and the goal you need to achieve.
2.  **Configure Devices**: Fill in the unshaded fields with the correct network parameters.
3.  **Verify Your Solution**: Use the `[Check again]` button to test your configuration. The interface will indicate if the solution is correct.
4.  **Save and Advance**: Upon successful completion of a level, download your configuration using the `[Get my config]` button, then proceed to the next.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the folder**:
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/42_cursus.git
     cd 42_cursus/NetPractice/Exercises
    ```
2.  **Open the interface**:
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **Enter your login (if you have one)**:
    Make sure to enter your 42 login in the provided field. This is crucial for generating the correct configuration files for submission.
	*If you do not have a 42 login and simply wish to experiment with the interface, you may leave the login field blank.*
---

## Submission

You must submit the ten configuration files generated by the NetPractice interface—one for each level—as proof of successful completion.
Subsequently, you must repeat the entire project from scratch under the supervision of your peer evaluators, within a predefined time frame. This evaluation must be performed without any form of cheating, and strict adherence to the time constraint is mandatory.

- **File Naming**: The files will be named `level1.json`, `level2.json`, and so on.
- **Location**: Place all 10 `.json` files in the root of the `NetPractice` directory.
---

## Learning Outcomes

This project provides a solid foundation in:

- **Network Fundamentals**: Understanding the roles of different network devices.
- **IP Addressing**: Mastery of subnetting and IP address allocation.
- **Routing**: Basic concepts of how data is routed between networks.
- **Systematic Troubleshooting**: A systematic and rigorous approach to identifying and resolving network issues.

## Credits

The NetPractice project was designed and developed by 42 School as part of its core curriculum.
This directory contains the .json configuration files generated during the successful completion of all ten levels, individually solved in accordance with the project’s official evaluation standards.

All configurations were completed by by [denuen](https://github.com/denuen) as part of the 42 School curriculum.
Special thanks to the 42 community for guidance and inspiration.
